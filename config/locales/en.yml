Until the moment of exchanging gifts, no one knows who is giving a gift to whom. And not a single participant knows who got his name."
      p3: "First of all, you should log in to the site, then on the main page you can create a room to whichyour friends will be able to connect. Also, after creating a room, you will be able to send an invitation to your friend yourself, whichwill be displayed in his profile.All rooms are in your profile. By clicking on the name of the room, you will go to this room and see detailed information, and you can alsostart drawing gifts at any time."
